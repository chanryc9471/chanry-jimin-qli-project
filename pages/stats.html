    <h4 class="text-center fw-bold pad-around">These statistics were based off of our survey in which we gathered 254 high school students across NYC. We asked students on their demographics, behavioral, knowledge and attitudinal questions. All of these questions were used to analyze the knowledge gap between students across NYC and helped determine our solution to combat school food waste in NYC.</h4>

              <p class="lh-base text-center">From the 254 of the students we surveyed in highschools across NYC, 50.4% of students have seen their cafeteria trash cans be filled up to the brim or overfilling with wasted food. This raises a concern as multiple highschools are seen with mass amounts of food being wasted with little action to combat it.</p>

              <p class="lh-base text-center">Additionally, 56.7% of students surveyed indicate that they have some sort of food left over in their plate before they throw out their meals. This is direct proof of food waste being thrown out in large amounts in different highschools in NYC. Well over half of the students donâ€™t finish their plates which raises a massive concern seeing how almost all NYC high schools have more than 1000+ students. </p>

              <p class="lh-base text-center">61.4% of students from our survey say they have some to no experience at all distinguishing what to put in trash vs recycle in cafeterias. Students seem to have little knowledge on how to organize their trash in cafeteria bins which could be the leading problem of food waste in schools. If we change this knowledge gap between students, there may be a huge difference in the reduction of food waste in schools.</p>
