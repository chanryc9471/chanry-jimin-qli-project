                <p class="card-text">One of the ways we can help eliminate food waste all around is by donating uneaten food or left over food to organizations for them to put into community fridges. Grassroot Grocery does exactly this, a non-profit organization that distributes food to food pantries while also handing out food to those in need as well. Every Saturday, they take the time to distribute food to those that need it and help deliver uneaten food to different parts of the community. It's a special way to bond with those that are also helping others and a great act towards combating food waste. (Source: Grassroots Grocery)</p>

                <p class="card-text">ReFed, another non-profit organization finds solutions to food waste in different ways. This website created by ReFed, allows users to interact with their database in which they collected from the internet. The website offers specific data on how food waste impacts different communities, environments, and places. The database had insights on specifically school food waste which also listed out the economic budgeting a school was wasting on school food waste as well as how much the federal government spends. The website offers various datasets and solutions on food waste in various different settings. </p>

                <p class="card-text">The USDA, United States Department of Agriculture, goes over reducing food waste at K-12 schools. They offer strategies and solutions to help allow students to minimize school food waste as well as guiding schools on how they can prevent wasted food. Some of their solutions are as simple as extending the lunch period to ensure students are eating all of their meals, creating designated stations where students can drop off uneaten food that the school can donate, or changing the menu offered by schools for students to eat what they would like to eat. </p>

                <p class="card-text">There is without a doubt that food waste is a conflict that impacts everyone and the environment around us. One way we can combat this is by spreading awareness to NYC district schools of cafeteria food waste and by allowing students to be knowledgeable in distinguishing what to put in trash vs recycle. One by one, we can reduce the amount of food waste not just only in schools but worldwide as well. Help us combat food waste by signing this petition!</p>
